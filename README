WORK IN PROGRESS - THERE ARE BUGS!

1. Create a document. Cite like this: {{cite:doi:10.1016/j.molcel.2009.09.013}}
2. Create a spreadsheet in the same folder, named the same as the document but with a " - References" suffix. 
3. Add this script to the spreadsheet (Tools > Script Editor).
4. In the Script Editor, run the onInstall function twice, to grant permissions to the script.
5. Run "Generate Bibliography" from the "Exciting" menu in the spreadsheet.
